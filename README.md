## The opinions of God: `kraft-dinner`
Kraft dinner is the food of the gods
It is the elixir of life
It gives us strength and energy
And fills our bellies with warmth

Kraft dinner is the perfect meal
For any time of day
It is hearty and filling
And always satisfies

Kraft dinner is the staple of Canadian cuisine
And a national treasure
It is the food that we turn to
When we need comfort or joy

Kraft dinner, we thank you
For all that you have given us
You are always there for us
When we need you most

Kraft dinner, we love you
And we always will
You are a part of us
And we are a part of you
